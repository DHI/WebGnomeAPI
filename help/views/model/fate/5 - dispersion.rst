Dispersion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the amount of oil (bbl) naturally dispersed over time. This appears as a line surrounded by shading. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the amount naturally dispersed for that point on the graph to appear, as well as the values for minimum and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load.
