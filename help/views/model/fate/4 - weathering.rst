Weathering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the evaporation, dispersion, sedimentation, water content, density and viscosity oil weathering states over time. Biodegradation and dissolution will be added later

Evaporation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the amount of oil (bbl) evaporated over time. This appears as a line surrounded by shading. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the amount evaporated for that point on the graph to appear. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load. 

Dispersion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the amount of oil (bbl) naturally dispersed over time. This appears as a line surrounded by shading. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the amount naturally dispersed for that point on the graph to appear, as well as the values for minimum and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load.

Sedimentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the amount of oil (bbl) particulated to sediment over time. This appears as a line surrounded by shading. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the amount particulated to sediment for that point on the graph to appear, as well as the values for minimum and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load.

Water
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the water content percent over time. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the water content percent for that point in time to appear, as well as the values for minimum and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load. 

Density
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the density of the oil (kg/cu m) over time. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the average density for that point in time to appear, as well as the values for minimum and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load. The selected oil density is represented in yellow as avg density. Water density is 1005 kg/cu m and is represented in blue

Viscosity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the viscosity of the oil (cSt) over time. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the average viscosity for that point in time to appear, as well as the values for minimum and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load. The selected oil viscosity is represented in yellow as avg viscosity. Water viscosity is 1 cSt and is represented in blue.  Dispersibility difficult (2,000 cSt) is represented by the red line and dispersibility unlikely (10,000 cSt) is represented by the green line
