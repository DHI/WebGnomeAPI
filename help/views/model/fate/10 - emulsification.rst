What factors affect when an oil starts to emulsify?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Not all oils will emulsify and some oils will emulsify only after they have weathered to a certain extent. Trace metal content may play a factor in the emulsification of fresh crude oils. Oils with vanadium and nickel content above 15 ppm often emulsify while those with less do not. However, for most oils, it appears that wax and, most importantly, asphaltene content play the dominant role in determining whether emulsification will occur. Waxes and asphaltenes may be considered as solutes in a solvent consisting of the lighter hydrocarbon components of the oil. As the oil weathers and loses the light ends, these large molecules may precipitate out, forming crystals which stabilize small water droplets in the oil. Resin level may play a role as well, since resins help to maintain asphaltenes in solution but also can act alone as effective emulsifiers. A common, but not necessarily reliable, rule-of-thumb, is that crude oil will emulsify when the wax and asphaltene content reach 5% of the mass of the oil.

    Light refined products generally will not emulsify since they do not contain the right hydrocarbon components to stabilize the water droplets. In rare cases, old diesel spills appear to emulsify, perhaps due to the creation of emulsifying molecules by photo-oxidation. Bunker fuels may form weak emulsions with relatively low water content.
