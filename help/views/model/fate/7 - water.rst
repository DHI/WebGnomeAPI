Water
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the water content percent over time. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the water content percent for that point in time to appear, as well as the values for minium and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load.
