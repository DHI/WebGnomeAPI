Oil Budget - Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab helps to visualize the data from the Oil Budget - Table tab. The three pie charts at top show the amount of oil that is dispersed, floating, and evaporated for Least Floating, Expected Floating, and Most Floating. This allows the user to see both the expected result as well as both the most and least conservative extimate. The graph displays this data over time. Hover your mouse over the graph at any point and the pie charts will adjust to show the exact amounts for that time. For longer duration spills, the graph may take some time to load. If labels on the pie charts are difficult to see, please refer to the Oil Budget - Table tab.
