Evaporation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the amount of oil (bbl) evaporated over time. This appears as a line surrounded by shading. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the amount evaporated for that point on the graph to appear. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load.
