Density
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows the density of the oil (kg/cu m) over time. The line represents the most likely amount, while the shading represents uncertainty. Hovering your mouse over the graph will cause the average density for that point in time to appear, as well as the values for minimum and maximum uncertainty. For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load.
