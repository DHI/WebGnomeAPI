ICS209
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab is designed to help the user fill out the ICS209 form. While the graph initially shows the entire spill run, you can change the start and end time to show only a portion of the run.

To change the report period, enter the Start Time or select the date and time using the calendar icon next to the entry box. To enter a date and time manually, use date format yyyy/mm/dd and time format 00:00 (24-hour clock). To select a date using the calendar, click on the calendar icon next to the start time entry. Click on the left or right arrows to change the month, and click on a date square to select it. Select a time from the list to the right of the calendar, scrolling up or down as necessary.

Use the drop-down menu to the right to change the units.
