Requested Prediction
========================================

**`Weathering Only`** predicts the fate and behavior of oil. This is location independent and therefore does not use a map or coordinates, however, it requires information on type and nature of the spill, wind, and water.

**`Trajectory Only`** predicts the trajectory of spilled oil. This requires information on type and nature of the spill, wind, and location.

**`Weathering & Trajectory`** predicts the fate, behavior, and trajectory of oil and requires information on type and nature of the spill, wind, water, and location.


* Choose a requested prediction by clicking on one of the three icons for: weathering only, trajectory only, or weathering & trajectory. 
* Enter model information for spill, wind, water, or location by clicking on the plus icon next to each box. Model requirements will change depending upon the type of prediction you selected. A check mark and a pencil icon will appear in the box as each requirement is filled in. The associated data for Spill, Wind, Water or Location will appear below the label.
* You can edit Spill, Wind, Water or Location data by clicking on the pencil icon in each box.

Once all requirements are met, a `Response Option` graph will appear at the bottom of the screen. Click the plus sign to select an optional response option.
