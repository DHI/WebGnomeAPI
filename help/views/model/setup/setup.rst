Setup View
^^^^^^^^^^

Use Setup View to configure and edit a model scenario. Individual panels are used to interact with different
types of model input. Individual panels include buttons to add (+), edit (pencil), and delete (trashcan) components.

Panels may contain multiple objects that can be edited individually. For example, multiple currents or winds can be added to the 
model and turned on/off as needed.


Advanced Settings
-----------------

Within each panel, Advanced settings for additional control over model parameters can be accessed via the pull down menu at the bottom.
