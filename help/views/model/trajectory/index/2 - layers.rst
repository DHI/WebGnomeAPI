Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Layers tab on the right side of the window allows you to show or hide 
information on the trajectory map. The model map, spill source location, and 
model particles are visible by default but can be toggled on and off using
the layers panel.

Background maps including satellite imagery can also be selected from this panel.


Additional information that can be made visible includes:

* The "map bounds" - once particles leave the map boundaries they are no longer tracked
* The "spillable area", i.e. the polygon within which a spill can be created
* The underlying model grid for any griddded wind or current data that has been added to the model
* Velocity vectors for gridded wind and/or current data
