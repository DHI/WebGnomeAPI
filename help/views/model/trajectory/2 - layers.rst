Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Layers tab on the right side of the window allows you to show or hide 
information on the trajectroy map. The model map, spill source location, and 
model particles are visible by default. 

Additional background map options are available by clicking the white box above the layers
panel.

Additional information that can be made visible includes:

* The "map bounds" - once particles leave the map boundaries they are no longer tracked
* The "spillable area", i.e. the polygon within which a spill can be created
* The underlying model grid for any griddded wind or current data that has been added to the model
* Velocity vectors for gridded wind and/or current data
