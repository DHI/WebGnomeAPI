Trajectory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This screen shows the trajectory of the oil. 

Running the trajectory
========================================

The spill duration indicator along the top includes a rewind, play/pause and fast forward button. You may also go to any spot in the model run by dragging the bar, by clicking at any spot in the spill duration bar, or by hovering the mouse over the spill duration indicator and using the arrow keys to advance the run one timestep at a time. The date and time of the spill changes as the trajectory model runs.

Begin by pressing the triangular play button at the top of the screen. Look at the map and find the black dots that represent the moving oil. You can move the map by clicking and dragging.
