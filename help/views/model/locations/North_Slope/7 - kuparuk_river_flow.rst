Kuparuk River Flow
==================================================

The Kuparuk River flows into Gwydyr Bay and is also simulated with user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate, or can enter a flow rate based on real-time or historical flow values. 

The three flow values available in the pull-down menu are the mean flow rate (2250 cfs) plus/minus the standard deviation (1550 cfs) calculated from historical flow data from 1971-1999. The historical measurements were taken between July 1 and August 31, with flow rates greater than 10,000 cfs discarded, as we did not simulate these flooding conditions in this Location File.
