Mackenzie River Flow
==============================================

The Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea and is simulated via user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate, or can enter a flow rate based on real-time or historical flow values.

The three flow values available in the pull-down menu are the high, medium and low flow rates (30000, 20000, and 10000 m3 s-1) calculated from historical flow data from 1972-2010.

To obtain real-time or historical flow values for the Mackenzie River, see the Environment Canada – Water Survey of Canada hydrometric data web page for the `Mackenzie River at Arctic Red River`_ . Under the heading, Data Category, select "Real-Time." Under the heading, Parameter Type, select "Discharge." Next to Parameter Type, click "Redraw." A time-series graph of the discharge is provided in cubic meters per second.

**Note:** For the Mackenzie River, high, mean, and low estimates were derived from `historical data recorded from 1972 to 2010`_ (and from investigation of the hydrology of the Mackenzie River by the Water Survey of Canada. Additional analysis of these data was provided by the `Canadian Mackenzie GEWEX`_ (Global Energy & Water Cycle Experiment) Study. In situ measurements of discharge and the resultant current speeds at principal channels of the Mackenzie were provided by Water Survey of Canada (Roger Pilling – Hydrometric Supervisor, personal communication, June 21, 2012).
