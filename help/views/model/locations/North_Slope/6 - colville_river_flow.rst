Colville River Flow
============================================

The Colville River flows into Harrison Bay and is simulated with user interaction in this Location File. The user can choose one of three flow values as estimates of the flow rate. 

The three flow rates (20,000 cfs, 10,000 cfs, and 3,000 cfs) are estimates of high, medium, and low flow rates for river flow after the extremes of the spring freshet have passed. The 1996 Colville River Delta Channel Assessment by Shannon & Wilson, Inc. was used for flow estimates.
