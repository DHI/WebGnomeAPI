Current Patterns
======================================

The Panama Canal, Atlantic Location File uses two current patterns to simulate circulation on the Atlantic side of the canal. 

One of the patterns models the coastal flow. 

A wind-driven circulation pattern is used to simulate wind driven flow offshore: one pattern from NW winds and another from NE winds. These two patterns are combined linearly to produce a current pattern appropriate for the user-defined wind field.

The current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
