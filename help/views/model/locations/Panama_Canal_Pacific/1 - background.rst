About Panama Canal Pacific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Panama Canal Pacific covers the Pacific side of the Panama Canal. It is one of a set of three location files that model the Panama Canal.


Background
=============================================

This location is designed to simulate oil spills at the entrance to the Panama Canal from the Pacific Ocean. In the canal entrance, the currents are primarily tidally driven -- the tidal currents are simulated with a flood current pattern tied to the tide station at Balboa, near the Bridge of the Americas. 

Outside of the entrance, in the Bay of Panama, the tidal influence continues through the ship canal, and then lessens outside the channel. Further outside the entrance to the canal, there is a coastal current in the Bay of Panama that is driven by the circulation in the greater Gulf of Panama. The current pattern simulated in GNOME captures the flow as modified by the local shoreline and bathymetry. The overall strength of the flow is determined by the larger scale circulation in the Gulf of Panama. Typically, the flow is counter-clockwise, and about 0.3 knots (0.15 m/s) at the scaling location, located southwest of the entrance at: 8.7534°N--79.6358°W.
