Current Patterns
======================================

The Panama Canal, Gatun Lake Location File uses four current patterns to simulate circulation in the lake and flow in the canal. 

One of the currents models flow from the Chagres River down the canal toward the Pacific and another models flow from the Chagres River towards Lake Gatun, and a third models flow from other inlets to the lake. The high, medium, and low flow values were extrapolated from mean flow reported in ...

A wind-driven circulation pattern is used to simulate wind driven flow in the lake: one pattern from NW winds and another from NE winds. These two patterns are combined linearly to produce a current pattern appropriate for the user-defined wind field.

All current patterns were created with the NOAA Current Analysis for Trajectory Simulation (CATS) hydrodynamic application.
