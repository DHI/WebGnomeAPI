About Panama Canal Gatun Lake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Gatun Lake Location File models flow from the Chagras River through controlled releases from the Madden Dam into Lake Gatun and down the Canal towards the Pacific. In addition to the Chagres River, the lake receives the waters of numerous rivers and streams. Gatun Lake is part of the route followed by shipping through the Panama Canal. 


Background
=============================================

Gatun Lake is a massive artificial lake crossing through Panama between the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It forms a major part of the Panama Canal, transiting ships for 33 km across the Isthmus of Panama. The lake was created between 1907 and 1913 during the creation of the Gatun Dam. 
Circulation in the region is driven primarily by controlled releases from the Madden Dam. River flow from smaller tributaries does not have a significant impact on surface currents in the lake.
