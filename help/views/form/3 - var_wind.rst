`Variable Wind`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variable Winds allows you to enter a series of wind information.

Add an entry to the wind series by choosing `Wind Speed` units from the drop-down menu at the top of the table. The same units will be used for all wind speed entries.

Use the `Wind Speed Uncertainty` slider by dragging the bar to the left or right to change the percent uncertainty. When using uncertainty, the speed will be displayed in the table as a range.

`Wind Direction` and Speed can be entered either by typing a value in the Speed entry box or by clicking in the wind bullseye. 

* Wind direction can be entered as degrees (between 0 and 360 degrees) or by the cardinal directions N, NE, NNE, NW, NNW, E, S, SE, SSE, SW, SSW, W. Cardinal directions will be automatically be translated into degrees. Enter a value for speed.
* To select wind speed and direction using the `bullseye`, click and drag inside the bullseye to change the length of the arrow to indicate speed and the direction of the arrow to indicate the direction of the wind.

Once Wind Speed uncertainty, Date & Time, Speed, and Wind Direction are entered, click Add Entry. Repeat until your wind series is complete. Entries can also be added at fixed hourly increments, allowing you to ignore Date and Time once the inital values are set. 6 hour increments are set by default.

To edit an entry, click on the entry in the table, adjust speed or direction, and click Add Entry.

To delete an entry, click on the entry in the table and click on the trash can icon to the right of the entry.
