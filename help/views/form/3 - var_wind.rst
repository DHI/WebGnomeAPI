Variable Wind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variable Winds allows you to enter a series of wind information.

First, choose the Wind Speed units from the drop-down menu at the top of the table. The same units will be used for all wind speed entries.

Use the Wind Speed Uncertainty slider by dragging the bar to the left or right to change the percent uncertainty. When using uncertainty, the speed will be displayed in the table as a range. Uncertainty can be adjusted for each entry as needed.

Note that the Date and Time will automatically increment for the next entry based on the value in the Inc.(hrs) entry box, allowing you to ignore Date and Time once the initial values are set. 6 hour increments are set by default. Date & Time can also be changed manually for each entry.

Wind Direction and Speed can be entered either by typing a value in the Speed entry box and Wind direction box, or by clicking in the wind bull’s-eye.
