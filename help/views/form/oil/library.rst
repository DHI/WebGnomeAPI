Oil Query Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Oil Query Form offers several ways to search for an oil.

* Use the **Search** field to search for an oil by name or location.
* Use the **Category** drop-down menu to search by category.
* Use the **API** slider by clicking and dragging the bars to select
  a range of values to narrow down the list of choices by American Petroleum Institute gravity, or API gravity. This is a measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water: if its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks.

If your oil does not appear in the list, try alternate spellings of the oil
or try broadening your search by setting the API at their
maximum ranges and/or choosing the Category All.

Oils can be sorted by **Name**, **Location**, **API**, or **Quality** index
by clicking on the column label at the top of the table. The **Quality** index is a measure of the completeness of the oil data record. A low Quality index means that many of the properties used in the oil weathering algorithms are estimated.

A more detailed view of a single oil in the list can be invoked by hovering
your mouse over the oil you are interested in.  When this is done, a button
will appear labeled 'More Info'.
Click that button to get more detailed information about the oil's
Properties, Distillation, and other details.  Estimated values appear as
highlighted red text. When you are satisfied with your choice, click the
**Select** button.
