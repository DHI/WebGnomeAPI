Observed beached oil
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This form allows the manual entry of volumes of observed beached oil for the mass balance. Note, if the trajectory is run with a map that contains land, 
the model may also cause oil to come ashore due to winds and currents. These processes are completely independent and values entered here will be removed 
from the mass balance as long as sufficient surface oil remains. (It is possible to enter larger values here than were actually released -- 
no validation is performed.)
