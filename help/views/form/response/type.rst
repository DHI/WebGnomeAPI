Select Response Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three Response types available in this model: In-Situ Burn, Disperse, and Skim.

In-situ burning is a cleanup technique which removes oil by burning it while it is still floating on the water. Generally, the minimum thickness for fresh oil to burn is two to three millimeters. For emulsified oil, the minimum thickness is probably closer to five millimeters. Oil which is allowed to spread without restriction will usually quickly become too thin to sustain a burn. It therefore becomes necessary to collect the oil by using specially designed fire-proof booms towed through the slick.

Dispersant chemicals are a way to treat spills over a large area. Dispersants reduce the surface tension between oil and water. This allows the dispersion of the surface oil into small droplets in the water column. Dispersion occurs naturally, but can be enhanced by adding dispersants.

Skimming is a way to remove oil from the surface of the water using boom and an oil skimmer. Skimming removes both oil and water and can only be used in calm or low wave conditions.
