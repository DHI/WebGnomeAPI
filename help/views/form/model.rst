Setup some basic information for your scenario.

* Choose a meaningful **Incident Name** or use the default.
* Set the **Start Time** for your incident by clicking on the calendar or entering it in the box. In general, this should be the same as the spill start time -- if the model start time is later than the spill start time this will cause an error. Also, dates pre-1970 are not supported.
* Set the model run **Duration**.
* Choose whether to include **Uncertainty** in the particle transport. Note that at this time, this only affects the movement of the particles (not the weathering) Uncertainty particles will not weather (their mass will be conservative). |uncert_link|
