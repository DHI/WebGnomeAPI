Either a point or line spill can be placed on the map. 

* **Zoom** in or out by using a mouse scroll wheel or the +/- buttons on the left.
* Set a **point spill** by selecting the ship icon |fixed_spill| then clicking anywhere on the map. Once set, the location can be changed *either* by dragging the base of the spill marker icon |spill_marker| or by re-selecting the ship icon and clicking a new location on the map.
* Set a **line spill** by selecting the moving ship icon |moving_spill| then clicking a start and end point on the map. Once the line is drawn, start and end points can be refined by dragging the points.
