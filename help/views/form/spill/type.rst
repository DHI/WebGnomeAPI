Choose **Point/Line Instantaneous Release** to simulate oil spilled very quickly at a point location or along a line. This option can also be used if very little information is available about the release, but you are able to make an estimate of the amount spilled.

Choose **Continuous Release** if the oil is spilled at a point or along a line over a period of time longer than one hour.

Choose **NOAA/NESIDS Spatial Release** to load a Marine Pollution Surveillance Report of remotely detected potential oil releases.
