Continuous Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Continuous Release contains multiple tabs where you must enter information. If you selected Weathering Only, then you will see General, Substance, Amount Spilled, and Constant Spill Rate tabs. If you selected Trajectory only, or Trajectory and Weathering, then you will also see a Map tab.

Begin by entering the name of the spill. Use descriptive names, particularly if you will be modelling more than one spill.

Click on each tab and fill out the form. A green check mark will appear next to each tab when the information for that tab is complete. A red X next to a tab meas that more information is needed.

General
====================

* Enter the start date and time or select the date and time using the calendar icon next to the entry box. To enter a date and time manually, use date format yyyy/mm/dd and time format 00:00 (24-hour clock). To select a date using the calendar, click on the calendar icon next to the start time entry. Click on the left or right arrows to change the month, and click on a date square to select it. Select a time from the list to the right of the calendar, scrolling up or down as necessary.
* Enter a Max Duration in Days and hours.

Amount Spilled
===================================

* Enter the Amount Spilled and select units from the drop-down menu.
* Click and drag the Confidence in Spilled Amount slider to indicate how certain or uncertain you are about the amount of substance spilled. A range will appear above the slider. Select the range which best represents your confidence.

Constant Spill Rate
===================================

* Enter the Spill Rate and select units from the drop-down menu.
* Click and drag the Confidence in Data slider to indicate how certain or uncertain you are about the amount of substance spilled. A range will appear above the slider. Select the range which best represents your confidence.

Substance
=====================

Click Select Substance. This will open the Oil Query Form. This may take a few moments to load.

If you want to change the substance spilled, you can select an oil that you have recently selected from the list at the bottom of the window, or click on Edit Substance to choose a new substance.


Emulsion Override
===============================

ADIOS-GNOME assumes that emulsion begins when 30% of the oil has been evaporated. You have the option of overriding this and specifying when you want emulsion to begin. Click on the button next to the entry field. Choose hours from the drop-down menu and type in the number of hours that have elapsed before emulsion begins, or choose percent from the drop-down menu and type in the percent of the spill that has been evaporated.

Map
==================================

This tab will appear if you have chosen Trajectory Only or Weathering & Trajectory. If you have already entered a location, this location will be marked on the map.

First, locate where the spill occurred on the map. Zoom in or out using the plus and minus icons, or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse. The map can be moved by clicking and dragging. 

To select a start and end position, click once on the map at the start position and then double-click on the map at the end position. This will be shown as a blue line on the map. The start and end position can be entered as many times as necessary until you are satisfied with the results. 

To select a single release point, double-click on the map twice in the same spot. An icon will appear to mark the location. 

Latitude and longitude can also be entered in the entry boxes below the map.
