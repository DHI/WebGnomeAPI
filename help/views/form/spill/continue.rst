`Emulsion Override`
===============================

ADIOS-GNOME assumes that `emulsion` begins when 30% of the oil has been evaporated. You have the option of overriding this and specifying when you want emulsion to begin. Click on the button next to the entry field. Type in the number of hours that have elapsed before emulsion begins and choose hours from the drop-down menu, or Type in the percent of the spill that has been evaporated and choose percent from the drop-down menu.

If you have chosen `Trajectory Only` or `Weathering & Trajectory`, a map will appear at the bottom of the screen. If you have not entered a location in the `Location` box, click Save. Choose a location from the Location box. Edit your spill by hovering your mouse over the name of your spill below the Spill box and clicking on the pencil icon.

If you have already entered a location, this location will appear as a highlighted area on the map. The map can be moved by clicking and dragging. `Zoom` in or out using the plus and minus icons, or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse.
