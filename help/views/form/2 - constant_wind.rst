Constant Wind

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wind Direction and Speed can be entered either by typing a value or by clicking in the wind bull’s-eye. 

Wind direction can be entered as degrees (between 0 and 360 degrees) or by the cardinal directions N, NE, NNE, NW, NNW, E, S, SE, SSE, SW, SSW, W. Cardinal directions will be automatically be translated into degrees. Enter a value for speed and then select units from the drop-down menu.

To select wind speed and direction using the bull’s-eye, click and drag inside the bull’s-eye to change the length of the arrow to represent speed and the direction of the arrow to indicate the direction of the wind.

Change the Speed Uncertainty slider by dragging the bar to the left for certain and to the right for uncertain to change the range of wind speed that will be used. Range is calculated using a Rayleigh distribution.
