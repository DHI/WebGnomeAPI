`Constant Wind`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wind `Direction` and `Speed` can be entered either by typing a value or by clicking in the wind `bullseye`. 

Wind direction can be entered as degrees or by the cardinal directions N, E, S, W. `Cardinal` directions will be translated to `degrees`. Enter a value for speed and select units from the drop-down menu.

To select wind speed and direction using the bullseye, click and drag inside the bullseye to change the length of the arrow to represent speed and the direction of the `arrow` to indicate the direction of the wind.

Change the Speed `Uncertainty slider` by dragging the bar to the left for certain and to the right for uncertain to change the `range` of wind speed that will be used.
