Variable Wind

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variable Winds allows you to enter a series of wind information.

Add an entry to the wind series:

Choose Wind Speed units from the drop-down menu. The same units will be used for all wind speed entries, i.e., you can not have one entry using knots and another using miles/hour.

Change the Wind Speed Uncertainty slider by dragging the bar to the left or right to change the range of wind speed that will be used.

Wind Direction and Speed can be entered either by typing a value or by clicking in the wind bullseye. 

* Wind direction can be entered as degrees or by the cardinal directions N, E, S, W. Cardinal directions will be traslated to degrees. Enter a value for speed and select units from the drop-down menu.
* To select wind speed and direction using the bullseye, click and drag inside the bullseye to change the length of the arrow to represent speed and the direction of the arrow to indicate the direction of the wind.

Once Wind Speed uncertainty, Date & Time, Speed, and Wind Direction are entered, click Add Entry. Repeat untill your wind series is complete. Entries can also be added at fixed hourly increments, allowing you to ignore Date and Time once the inital values are set.

To edit an entry, click on the entry in the table, adjust speed or direction, and click Add Entry.

To delete an entry, click on the entry in the table and click on the trash can icon at the end of an entry.
