Wind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wind is a required element for both weathering and trajectory models.

It is important to note that oceanographers define the direction of the current as the direction toward which the wind is moving. This is the opposite convention adopted by meteorologists, who define wind direction as the direction from which the wind comes. Also, wind speeds are assumed to be at a 10 meter reference height above the water surface. Wind data that is measured at a different elevation must be adjusted to this reference height.

A common problem observed at many spills is that weather information comes from a variety of sources. If weather is provided by more than one source, it is likely that there will be differences between the forecasts. Coordinate weather support with other spill responders and get a verbal briefing by a meteorologist when possible. The wind data that you enter into the model should be consistent with the wind observations and forecasts used by the response community.

You can enter wind data in three ways: as a constant wind value, a set of variable wind values, or it can be imported from the National Weather Service (NWS).
