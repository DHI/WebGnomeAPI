When setting up a model, WebGNOME will try to automatically determine if sufficient information has been added in order to compute weathering. If these conditions are met, weatherers will automatically be added and made active. To enable weathering, the model setup requires: a spill with an oil selected from the database, wind, and water properties.  

If "Manual Mode" is selected for Weatherers, the model will no longer automatically turn weathering on/off as the setup changes.
