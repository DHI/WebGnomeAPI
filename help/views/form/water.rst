Both salinity and temperature are needed to determine the density of seawater. Density is a major factor in determining whether an oil will float or sink.

* Enter a water temperature and select units from the drop-down menu. Check units before proceeding.
* Select a Salinity value (psu) from the drop-down menu, or select Other Value from the drop-down menu to enter a custom value.
* Select Water Sediment Load (mg/L) from the drop-down menu, or select Other Value from the drop-down menu to enter a custom value.
* Enter Wave Height by selecting Compute from Wind, Computer from Wind and Fetch, or Known Wave Height. If you select Compute from Wind and Fetch, enter a value for Fetch and select the units from the drop-down menu. If you select Known Wave Height, enter a value for height and select the units.
* Click Save.
