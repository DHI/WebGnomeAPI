# These are software packages necessary to run the WebGnomeAPI web server.
# The format of this file should be compatible with either conda or pip,
# so these packages can be installed with the commands:
#
#     $ conda install --file conda_requirements.txt
#       -- or --
#     $ pip install -r conda_requirements.txt
#
# In addition to this list of packages, there is a file separate from
# conda_requirements.txt called simply requirements.txt.  This file contains
# a list of packages that are not found in any of the main conda channel
# repositories, so they are pip installable only.
#
# So after the previous step, one would normally do the following:
#
#     $ pip install -r requirements.txt

# numpy is not strictly needed by the API, but is by gnome, etc,
# and adding it helps keep conda from trying to downgrade it.
